			<h2>About Brock</h2><hr>

			<h3>What is Brock?</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Brock is a platform that is aimed at allowing a layman to develop apps for Android - without writing a single line of code!</strong> </p>

			<p>
				Let me give you a couple of scenarios before I proceed. Let's assume you are busy in a meeting, and you keep your phone in the silent mode. You want to tell anyone who calls that you will call them later by sending an SMS back automatically. You can easily configure your phone to do that. Or let's assume you don't want your wife to be worried when your phone is not being answered because your phone ran out of battery - You can configure your phone to automatically send an SMS to your wife if the battery level goes below 15% saying that your phone might go out, and to not worry. You can configure your phone to send an SMS as well as turn on Wi-Fi automatically the moment you enter into your office building (location aware) - And remember, all of this without writing a single line of code.</p>

			<p>
				How you ask? We provide a screen for you - that has two panes. Cause and Effect. You choose from among a list of causes (or combination) as to what should trigger the Effect. This could be things like Battery level dipping, getting an incoming call, a particular time period (schedule), your current location (GPS), movement, unlocking the phone, etc. You simply click on the button, and that gets added into the Causes section. Clicking on the Edit (pencil icon) will open up that cause for configuration where you provide information. In the Effect section, you specify what events should happen when triggered. This can be among sending an SMS, controlling Wi-Fi, setting a notification, launching an app, etc. The same process of configuration holds good. Once you are done, you click on Generate.</p>

			<p>
				At this point of time, I want to mention a fantastic platform my Microsoft, called on{x}. Essentially, on{x} is a product written by Microsoft for Android (Don't rub your eyes, you read it correctly) and that allows people to control their phone extremely well doing all of the things mentioned above. However, this requires the person who does it to know how to write code. An average person, who doesn't know to code cannot avail these awesome and very useful features. Enter Brock. By providing a very easy to use interface, a bunch of mouse clicks will generate the code behind the scenes for him. He merely has to copy-paste it into the on{x} code area - and this is because MS hasn't provided a way for us to directly call their services.</p>

			<p>
				So now, anyone can code, without knowing how to code</p>
				
			<p>
				<strong>Trivia:</strong><br>
				So why did I call it Brock? In Pokemon, there's a creature called Onix which is controlled by a character called Brock. Since our application controls on{x}, I called it Brock :-)  <i>- Nikhil Baliga</i>
